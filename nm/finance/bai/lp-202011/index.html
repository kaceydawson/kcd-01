<p class="bold">Dear Income Investor,</p>
<div class="photoRtom">
    <img src="images/th.jpg">
</div>
<p>My name is Tom Hutchinson.</p>
<p>You may recognize me from my <em>High Income Factor</em> newsletter that I&rsquo;ve been writing since 2011.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ve probably experienced for yourself, the COVID-19 crisis has made investing for <u>income</u> more challenging than it&rsquo;s ever been.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I dedicated most of my time throughout 2020 to investigating and testing the best income-generating opportunities available to investors and retirees.</p>
<p>And today I want to share an incredible breakthrough that could provide you with several thousand dollars in <em>extra</em> income each month.</p>
<p>Take a look for yourself:</p>
    
<!--<p>(insert image of stacks of cash with title: $2,000 Generated)</p>-->
<div class="photoRcash" style="width:30%">
    <img src="images/2000.jpg">
</div>
<p style="padding-top: 5em">One of these opportunities was able to generate <strong>$2,000</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="clear"></div>
    
<!--<p>(insert image of stacks of cash with title:  Another $2,460 )</p>    -->

<div class="photoLcash" style="width:35%">
    <img src="images/2460.jpg">
</div>
<p style="padding-top: 5em">While a second one could have handed you <strong>$2,460</strong>.</p>
<div class="clear"></div>

<!--<p>(insert image of twice as many stacks of cash as First image with title: An Extra $4,300 )</p>-->

<p class="boldCenter">And those were some of the smaller amounts!</p>

<div class="photoRcash" style="width:40%">
    <img src="images/4300.jpg">
</div>
<p style="padding-top: 5em">Below, I&rsquo;ll show you how I was also able to make an extra <strong>$4,300</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="clear"></div>
    
<!--<p>(insert image of twice as many stacks of cash as First image with title:  Another $5,780)</p>-->
<div class="photoLcash" style="width:50%">
    <img src="images/5780.jpg">
</div>
<p style="padding-top: 5em">Plus another <strong>$5,780</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="clear"></div>

<!--<p>(insert image of 4-times as many stacks of cash as First image with title:  $9,006 In Income)</p>-->
<div class="photoRcash" style="width:60%">
    <img src="images/9006.jpg">
</div>
<p style="padding-top: 10em">And even make up to <strong>$9,006</strong> in income using this tested and proven income strategy.</p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<br>    
<p>With these five opportunities alone&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;you could have added an <em>extra</em> $23,546 to your investment account in just a few months&rsquo; time.</p>
<p>Done over the course of an entire year, income-generating opportunities like these could potentially provide you with double&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;or even triple that amount.</p>
<p class="bold">That&rsquo;s an extra $47,092 to $70,638 in income each year.</p>
<p>And this is just the start!</p>
<p>In a moment, I&rsquo;ll share <em>exactly</em> how you could make this kind of extra cash for yourself over and over for years to come.</p>
<p>Now, keep in mind&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This income is <u>separate and in addition to the capital gains</u> from the carefully selected stocks I&rsquo;ve recommend to my 76,979+ readers who&rsquo;ve paid for my research over the past 10 years.</p>
<p>For example, just in the past year alone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve enjoyed <strong>41%</strong> gains on Visa&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<!--<p>(insert upward trending Visa chart with 41% gains)</p>-->

<p><strong>59%</strong> gains on Starbucks&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<!--<p>(insert upward trending Starbucks chart with 59% gains)</p>-->
<div class="chartCenter">

</div>
<p>And they were able to double their money with <strong>105%</strong> gains on Innovative Industrial Properties.</p>

</div>
<p>When it comes to taking profits&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;my readers (maybe you&rsquo;ve been one of them) have had the opportunity to bank:</p>
<p><strong>56%</strong> profits on V.F. Corp&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<strong>77%</strong> profits on Realty Income&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<strong>96%</strong> profits on Western Refining&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<strong>198%</strong> on Brookfield Infrastructure Partners&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and <strong>376%</strong> on Eli Lilly.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve followed my work and invested in the companies I&rsquo;ve recommended&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you already know my primary focus has been&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and continues to be&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;helping my readers make money and enjoy a comfortable, stress-free retirement.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re looking for a <em>safer</em> way to generate several hundred or even several thousand dollars in <u>extra income</u> from your savings&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And be able to do it month after month&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;no matter what happens in the financial markets&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;d like to share how you could start <em>multiplying</em> the income you receive on your investments today.</p>
    
<h2>Why I Believe This Could Be the SAFEST Income Strategy Available Today</h2>
<p>Over the past 10 years, I&rsquo;ve recommended several different income-generating strategies to my readers.</p>
<p>However, as we move into a new decade ahead&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;we&rsquo;re already seeing that what worked well back in 2011 doesn&rsquo;t hold the same promise as we proceed through 2021.</p>
<p>So while there are new challenges&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;there are also new and exciting opportunities.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve invested for income before, then you&rsquo;ll love this strategy I&rsquo;m about to share below because&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s <strong><u>better</u></strong> than Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS)&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s <strong><u>better</u></strong> than Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs)&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s <strong><u>better</u></strong> than Business Development Companies (BDCs).</li>
</ul>
<p>While I personally like those three investment vehicles, and how they traditionally have had the potential to deliver 8% to 12% average annual returns&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many retirees and investors are only starting to realize:</p>
<div class="chartCenter">
    <img src="images/tearsheet.jpg">
</div>
<!--<p class="quote">&ldquo;Unless you&rsquo;re already an expert income investor&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;it&rsquo;s now becoming much more difficult to find investments that provide reliable income to supplement your Social Security benefits, pensions, and savings.&rdquo;</p>-->
<p>This leaves many income-seeking retirees and investors between a rock and a hard place when trying to find safe income-generating investments&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;And also, to do it <em>without</em> tying up their hard-earned savings for long periods of time.</p>
<p>Just take a look at &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; income-producing investments:</p>
<p>Low-yield investments like money market accounts, Treasury bonds, CDs, muni bonds, and fixed annuities now only pay 0.11% to 2.65%&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;if you&rsquo;re lucky.</p>
<!--<p>Insert horizontal row of bar charts here with Money Market Accounts 0.11% , T-Bonds 0.98% , CDs 1.0% , Muni Bonds 1.2% , Fixed Annuities 2.65%</p>-->
<div class="photoCenterLg">
    <img src="images/collage-low-yield.jpg">
</div>
<p>So not only do you have to lock-up your cash for 2 years&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;5 years&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;even up to 7 years with those investments&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those paltry returns don&rsquo;t even allow you to keep up with inflation! </p>
<p>Because of bankers and politicians devaluing the dollar over the past several decades&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;today&rsquo;s pitiful interest rates have become absurd.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s downright insulting for those of us old enough to remember earning 4%&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;6%&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;even 8% or more on our savings with a basic 1-year CD at our local bank.</p>
<p>Those days are long gone.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m excited to share how you could quickly make <strong>6%</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<strong>11%</strong> (this was the average)&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;even up to <strong>24%</strong> returns on your money&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bold">&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;All without ever having to touch any of the starting capital in your investment account!</p>
<p>And instead of locking up your capital for years at a time&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll show you how you could make those kinds of returns in just 2-3 months.</p>
<p>This gives you far greater control and flexibility in allotting your capital to income investments that provide the <em>greatest</em> potential returns.</p>
<p>Plus, this could allow you to quickly compound your gains <em>faster</em> than any income-generating strategy you may have <em>ever</em> used before.</p>
<p class="bold">Now, here&rsquo;s the best part&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent much of 2020 refining&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;perfecting&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and making this so simple and user-friendly for my readers so that <em>anyone</em> could do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about making it as simple as being able to: <span class="kitTitle">POINT, CLICK&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and <u>CASH-OUT</u></span>!</p>
<p>In fact, you could doing this today and potentially have hundreds or even thousands of dollars deposited right into your investing account in less than 24 hours.</p>
<p>I promise you that you&rsquo;ve <em>never</em> seen anything like this.</p>
<p>But I must make this disclaimer&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
    
<h2>This Income Strategy Truly Is Incredible<br>But It Is <u>NOT</u> for Everyoneâ€¦</h2>
<p>Now, there <em>is</em> a catch to all of this.</p>
<p>In fact, there are two.</p>
<p>And because I don&rsquo;t want to waste your time&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll tell you what they are right now.</p>
<p>First, you must have some STARTING CAPITAL to use this income-generating strategy.</p>
<p>Now, I know that sounds like a no-brainer&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;but you wouldn&rsquo;t believe how many people today think money is just going to magically appear in their accounts!</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the good news&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="boldI">You <u>DON&rsquo;T</u> need a fortune to get started.</p>
<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ll even share a few different starting capital amounts and income scenarios below.  </p>
<p>And when you see them&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;you&rsquo;ll realize just how quickly you could generate extra cash&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;practically on demand.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re about to see is a proven strategy I&rsquo;ve successfully used myself and have recommended to others with increased frequency in recent years.</p>
<p>And depending on how much money you allocate to this strategy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It could allow you to add <strong>$2,000</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <strong>$2,460</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <strong>$4,300</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <strong>$5,780</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. even up to <strong>$9,006</strong> in extra cash per month to your existing sources of income.</p>
<p>And while that might not be like winning several million dollars by playing the lottery&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know anybody that would turn away that kind of extra cash each month!</p>
<p>So when you add that additional income to money you&rsquo;re receiving from your job, your Social Security payments, and your other retirement income from pensions or IRA/401(k) distributions&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="photoRlg">
    <img src="images/retire.jpg">
</div>
<p>It could provide you with a <em>very</em> comfortable retirement.</p>
<p class="bold">Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s even better&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These numbers I&rsquo;ve mentioned are based on a <em>conservative</em> amount of starting capital.</p>
<p>This means if you start with more&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;then you could generate an even higher monthly income.</p>
<p>Possibly much higher.</p>
<p>Plus, if you&rsquo;re like me and hate taking unnecessary risks with your hard-earned money&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be excited when you see how you can use this income strategy year after year&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and <u>never have to touch your starting capital</u> in your account if you don&rsquo;t want to!</p>
<p>Now, the second catch is this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am only making this available to the first 250 people who want to try this out for themselves, and start making <em>extra</em> investment income today.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t for amateurs or &ldquo;wishy-washy&rdquo; types of people. This is serious investment income for serious investors.</p>
<p>In fact, once you see my research and examples below&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;you&rsquo;ll know <em>immediately</em> if you&rsquo;re the right kind of person for this.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, I believe this is the <em>safest</em> income strategy available today&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;yet most investors have never heard of it.</p>
<p>And those few investors who do know about it&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and how to use it <u>successfully</u>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;are not telling their secrets.</p>
<p>But I am&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and you&rsquo;ll get to enjoy the financial benefits of what I&rsquo;m about to share&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
    
<h2>This Was Originally Available to <br class="displayDesktop">Only The Wealthiest Investors in the U.S.</h2>
<p>This powerful income generating strategy I&rsquo;ve been testing has been around for just over 50 years now.</p>
<p>However&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it was first made available to the public in 1970, only the <em>wealthiest</em> of investors could use it.</p>
<p class="bold">There were TWO reasons why:</p>
<p>First, as I mentioned earlier&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;you need starting capital to use this strategy.</p>
<p>And back in 1970s, there simply weren&rsquo;t all too many &ldquo;wealthy&rdquo; Americans in the first place with stagflation, the gas crisis, and mortgage rates topping 11%.</p>
<p>To further illustrate this point&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;there were only around 120,000 millionaires in the US in 1970 compared to over 18 million today!</p>
<p>The second reason this strategy was only available to the rich was because of access to &ldquo;privileged information.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In the &rsquo;70s, only the wealthiest people who invested in the stock market:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Knew these investments even existed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Knew how to get in on these opportunities&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Had stockbrokers and financial advisers that knew which ones had the most income-generating potential.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>But things are much different today&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and it works to your benefit when using this income-generating strategy!</em></p>
<p>For starters, you don&rsquo;t have to be a millionaire to get started or even have six-figures in the bank.</p>
<p>In fact, you could get started with less than $10,000 in starting capital.</p>
<p>And with my <span class="kitTitle">POINT, CLICK&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and <u>CASH-OUT</u></span> approach&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t even need to have access to a stockbroker or high-priced financial adviser to get information about (and direct access to) these income-generating investments.</p>
<p>I do all the &ldquo;heavy lifting&rdquo; for you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;provide you with the research&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and instruct you what to do.</p>
<p>Let me show you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
    
<h2>How You Could Pocket an Extra $4,300&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;$5,780&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Up To $9,006 in Extra Income (And Do It Over and Over Again!)</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever invested for income before&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;then you&rsquo;ve probably heard of selling covered calls.</p>
<p>And as I mentioned earlier&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;I believe it is the <em>safest</em> income-generating strategy available today.</p>
<p>Now, if you&rsquo;re not familiar with this strategy or haven&rsquo;t used covered calls before&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bold">Here&rsquo;s a simple explanation of how they work:</p>
<p>Writing a covered call means you&rsquo;re selling someone else the <u>right</u> to purchase a stock that you <em>already</em> own, at a specific price, within a specified time frame.</p>
<p>Because one contract to sell represents 100 shares&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;to use this strategy, you must own at least 100 shares for every call contract you plan to sell.</p>
<p>As a result of selling (&ldquo;writing&rdquo;) the contract for the covered call, you immediately pocket the premium right off the bat.</p>
<p><em>This is where we are able to generate several hundred or several thousand dollars in income from each and every contract.</em></p>
<p class="bold">And here&rsquo;s where it gets even BETTER when using covered calls&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we do this&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;we&rsquo;re only buying and holding good, solid stocks that we&rsquo;d want to have in our investment portfolio in the first place.</p>
<p>Plus, the fact that you <em>already</em> own the stock means you&rsquo;re &ldquo;covered&rdquo; if the stock price rises past the agreed-upon price and you deliver on the contract.</p>
<p>If this happens, you&rsquo;ll simply:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Sell the stock you <em>already</em> own for a profit, reaping the extra financial benefit of the increase on the stock&rsquo;s value&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Receive any dividends that were distributed, which boosts your total return.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now keep in mind&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;all of that is in <em>addition</em> to the money you originally received when you sold the covered call.</p>
<p>That means <u>even more income</u> for you to spend as you see fit, or to add back into your account so you can write more covered calls for even more income in the future!</p>
<p>So you can see this process in action&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll share a few examples from 2020 that I&rsquo;ve referenced earlier so you can see just how easy I&rsquo;ve made doing this for my readers.</p>
<p>And if you want to earn this kind of <em>extra</em> income&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;month after month&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll show you how you can join them and start putting extra income in your investment account today!</p>

<h2><span class="kitTitle">POINT, CLICK&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and <u>CASH-OUT</u></span></h2>
<h3>Income Opportunity #1:<br>Altria (MO)</h3>
<div class="photoShadow photoRlogo">
    <img src="images/logo-altria.jpg">
</div>

<p>Let me show you just how simple this can be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine that you bought Altria stock on June 2 at $39.66</p>
<p>And then sold the covered call on July 17.</p>
<p>Then, on July 10 you would have received an 86-cent dividend per share.</p>
<p>On July 31 the covered call would have expired at $1.60.</p>
<p>So, we were able to earn $1.60 plus a $0.86 dividend (a total of $2.46 per share) over the course of about two months.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that each contract is for 100 shares.</p>
<p>Now here&rsquo;s how much income you could have made on this opportunity:</p>
<p class="bold">
    1 contract = <span class="colorGreen">$246</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    5 contracts = <span class="colorGreen">$1,230</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    10 contracts = <span class="colorGreen">$2,460</span>
</p>
<p>And remember, you still would keep all the Altria stock you bought!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at another example&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
    
<h2><span class="kitTitle">POINT, CLICK&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and <u>CASH-OUT</u></span></h2>
<h3>Income Opportunity #2:<br>AbbVie (ABBV)</h3>
<div class="photoShadow photoRlogo">
    <img src="images/logo-abbvi.jpg">
</div>
<p>As you know, pharmaceutical companies were hot in 2020.</p>
<p>Say you bought AbbVie stock on June 2 at $91.04</p>
<p>And then you sold the covered call on July 15.</p>
<p>On August 14 you&rsquo;d have received a $1.18 dividend per share.</p>
<p>And on July 31 the covered call would have expired at $4.60.</p>
<p>So you would have been able to earn $4.60 plus a $1.18 dividend (a total of $5.78 per share) over the course of 3.5 months.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how much income you could have made on this opportunity:</p>
<p class="bold">
    1 contract = <span class="colorGreen">$578</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    5 contracts = <span class="colorGreen">$2,890</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    10 contracts = <span class="colorGreen">$5,780</span>
</p>
<p>And again in this case, you still would have been able to keep all the AbbVie stock you bought!</p>
<p>Now, let me show you what happens when our covered call gets &ldquo;called&rdquo; and why it&rsquo;s still great for us&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
    
<h2><span class="kitTitle">POINT, CLICK&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and <u>CASH-OUT</u></span></h2>
<h3>Income Opportunity #3:<br>US Bancorp (USB)</h3>
<div class="photoShadow photoRlogo">
    <img src="images/logo-usBancorp.jpg">
</div>
<p>Suppose you bought US Bancorp stock on July 22 at $36.26</p>
<p>And also sold the covered call on July 22.</p>
<p>For this profit opportunity, you wouldn&rsquo;t have received any dividends because they weren&rsquo;t distributed during this holding period.</p>
<p>On September 18 the covered call would have expired at $2.00 and was &ldquo;called&rdquo; as the stock price hit $37.50.</p>
<p>So you would have been able to earn $2.00 plus a $1.24 in capital appreciation (a total of $3.24 per share) in less than two months </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how much income you could have made on this opportunity:</p>
<p class="bold">
    1 contract = <span class="colorGreen">$324</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    5 contracts = <span class="colorGreen">$1,625</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    10 contracts = <span class="colorGreen">$3,240</span>
</p>
<p>Here, you could have made the money on the contract and profit from the sale of the stock&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; Allowing you to use that income any way you wanted, or add it back to your account to use toward other opportunities!</p>
<p>And I used this same process with other stocks as well.</p>
<p>Like with Qualcomm <strong>(QCOM)</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here we were able to generate <span class="colorGreen"><strong>$4,300</strong></span> in income for ourselves.</p>
<p>Plus, we had the chance to make <span class="colorGreen"><strong>$9,006</strong></span> from Innovative Industrial Properties <strong>(IIPR)</strong>.</p>
<p>From just these five income opportunities&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;you could have made an extra $23,546 in income.</p>
<p>As for the total amount of time it would have taken you to do it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bold">Less than one hour&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;for all 5 combined!</p>
<p>And remember&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;you&rsquo;re not doing this all by yourself&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;You&rsquo;re receiving guidance from me on each and every one of the income opportunities I identify, investigate, and recommend.</p>
<p>Like I promised you earlier&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;you&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this before!</p>
<p>This could truly be the safest way to generate extra investment income today&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Especially if you are &ldquo;sitting on the sidelines&rdquo; with cash looking for investments that could provide you with reliable returns.</p>
<p>So if you meet the criteria I mentioned earlier, and you want to make this kind of extra, stress-free income&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;month after month&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Then I&rsquo;d like to invite you to be among the first 250 people to try out my newest income advisory service called <em>Breakaway Income</em>.</p>
<p>This is the maximum number of Charter members we&rsquo;re allowing in at this time for reasons I&rsquo;ll share below&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="btnCenter">

<h2>Try Out <em>Breakaway Income</em> and You Could Make an Extra $2,000&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. $2,460&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. $4,300&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. $5,780&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Even Up to $9,006 Each and Every Month&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Starting Today!</h2>
<p>I created this top-tier &ldquo;done-for-you&rdquo; income advisory service for retirees and investors who:</p>
<ol>
    <li class="bold">Want to put their hard-earned savings to work and generate more income than they ever have before&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</li>
    <li class="bold">Want to do it with as little &ldquo;work&rdquo; as possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>After all, you&rsquo;re busy.</p>
<p>You certainly don&rsquo;t want to be spending most of your free time worrying about money or constantly researching investments and watching the markets.</p>
<p>You want to spend time with family, friends, and enjoying your hobbies.</p>
<p>For this service, I&rsquo;ll easily be spending 30-40 hours each week doing all the in-depth research to discover and report on the <em>best</em> income opportunities available.</p>
<p>The ones that have the potential to safely pay out the <em>most</em> amount of money&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;in the <em>least</em> amount of time.</p>
<p>Is all of this a lot of work? </p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>But I love what I do, and I know you&rsquo;ll love the results you&rsquo;ll get.</p>
<p>Plus, I made this whole process incredibly user-friendly.</p>
<p>So if you have a computer, tablet, or smart phone that you&rsquo;re reading this on right now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Then all you have to do is <span class="kitTitle">POINT, CLICK&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and <u>CASH-OUT</u></span>!</p>
<p>It really is that simple.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re a member&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Each time you receive an opportunity alert notification from me and open your investment account, you just:</p>
<p><span class="colorGreen"><strong>POINT</strong></span> to the stock and covered call option I recommend</p>
<p><span class="colorGreen"><strong>CLICK</strong></span> to confirm&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="colorGreen"><strong><u>CASH-OUT</u></strong></span> to deposit money in your account.</p>
<p>I promise that you&rsquo;ve never experienced a way to generate so much money with so little effort!</p>
<p>However&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Due to the supply and demand nature of these unique income opportunities, having too many people trying to use them actually diminishes their overall return.</p>
<p>And because I want each member of <em>Breakaway Income</em> to have the chance to make the <u>most</u> amount of income each opportunity alert I issue&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I&rsquo;m keeping the membership size of this group small.</p>
<p>Right now, during this enrollment period, I&rsquo;m only opening it up to 250 members.</p>
<p>Perhaps in the future, I may open it up to more if it doesn&rsquo;t impact the high income potential in the opportunities I investigate and recommend.</p>
<p class="bold">So for now&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;250 members is the limit.</p>

<h2>How to Claim Your Spot Right Now And <br class="displayDesktop">Start Generating Extra Income Today!</h2>
<p>My publisher has set the one year membership price for <em>Breakaway Income</em> to $1,995 a year.</p>
<p>And when you consider that you could make that amount&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and much more&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;from just the first recommendation I provide to you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that price is an absolute bargain.</p>
<p>But after talking with my publisher to reduce the price for Charter Members, he&rsquo;s agreed to offer a limited-time discount.</p>
<p class="bold">So if you&rsquo;re one of the first 250 people to get started today&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;you&rsquo;ll pay only $995.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s over <u>HALF-OFF</u> the retail rate.</p>
<p>And if you like, you could use your savings to put toward your first income investment.</p>
<p>Just imagine how great it&rsquo;ll be if you&rsquo;re able to recoup your entire membership fee from your first investment&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;And everything after that for the next year could be pure profit!</p>
<p class="bold">But please know that once those 250 spots are taken with this limited-time offer&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p class="bold">And when I say limited time&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;that means, by the time you click on the membership enrollment page&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="bold">&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; We may have already hit our membership limit and this offer may already be expired.</p>
<p class="boldHighlight">(If that&rsquo;s the case, you&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to be put on a priority first-alert waiting list, and will be notified when we open enrollment again.)</p>
<p>We have close to 1 million readers on our email lists, so I&rsquo;m sure those spots will be filled up quickly!</p>
<p>And if you are lucky enough to get in today, you&rsquo;ll be happy you took fast action&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;because my newest recommendation is right around the corner!</p>
<p class="bold">Plus, you can try out all of my work 100% risk-free for the next 60 days.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re not happy with my work or recommendations for any reason&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;or even no reason at all&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;simply let us know, and we&rsquo;ll offer you a full and prompt refund.</p>
<p>But I think that you&rsquo;re going to love my research and all the extra income it could provide you in the year to come.</p>
<p>And it couldn&rsquo;t come at a better time, as many people are already starting to feel the financial aftermath of what happened to the economy and financial markets in 2020.</p>
<p>As I said at the beginning of this letter:</p>    
<p class="quote">&ldquo;Unless you&rsquo;re already an expert income investor&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;it&rsquo;s now becoming much more difficult to find investments that provide reliable income to supplement your Social Security benefits, pensions, and savings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good news is you don&rsquo;t have to be an expert income investor&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;because you got me by your side.</p>
<p>When you get started today&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have the chance to immediately start making an extra <strong>$2,000</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <strong>$2,400</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <strong>$4,300</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <strong>$5,780</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. even up to <strong>$9,006</strong> each and every month!</p>
<p>Now for some exceptionally wealthy individuals, some of those amounts may seem like &ldquo;chump change.&rdquo; </p>
<p>However, for most of the people I know these days&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;hard-working people who have diligently saved their money and want to put it to work and receive a decent return&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having the opportunity to receive even an extra $1,000 a month would make a world of difference.</p>
<p>And if you could use more income from your investments so you don&rsquo;t have to lose sleep at night&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;worrying if you&rsquo;ll have enough savings to last the rest of your days&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;d like to help you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;just like I&rsquo;ve help tens of thousands of my readers make exceptional profits and earn life-changing income since 2011.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t expect this enrollment period to be open for long, and I hope you can secure an open spot.</p>
